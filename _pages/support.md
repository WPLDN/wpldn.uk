				Sponsor the WordPress London Meetup

	<p>We've been looking for ways to help support the WordPress community, so we have volunteered our time to help build on an already very successful WordPress London meetup. Now with nearly 2,500 members and a regular monthly attendance of 80 developers, designers, freelancers, and WordPress users the events always have a great buzz about them. The event is well-established, with over 70 events since Aug. 2008.</p>
<p>With attendee numbers rising and an increased demand for great content, costs associated with venues, catering, photography/videography and video transcriptions, are also increasing. I'd like to take this opportunity to invite you to sponsor the WordPress London meetup.</p>
