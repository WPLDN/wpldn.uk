	<h2>Before Applying</h2>
<p>Before applying to become a speaker, here are a few bits of information you should know.</p>
<p>As per the standard WordPress community, we do NOT pay speakers, nor cover speaker expenses, such as hotel, travel or food (though we do have some food available to all attendees on the night).</p>
<p>As our event is typically two and a half hours on one evening each month, we don't have a speakers dinner. We do typically have 30 minutes of networking before the opening remarks, and an opportunity to network after the presentations have finished.</p>
<p>Main talks should last 25-30 minutes, with 5-10 minutes for a post-talk question and answer session. The total time allocated for your talk is 35 minutes.</p>
<p>Lightning talks should last 10 minutes, with an optional opportunity for engaging the audience in some points of discussion.</p>
<p>We don't have the ability for specific child care support, though youngsters who ideally won't disturb the presentations are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>Our venue is a university, so is sufficiently accessible.</p>
<p>Even if we have agreed for you to speak at an event, we still require speakers to fill out the form below. Only when this is done do we consider the application to speak to be formally submitted, so that it may be accepted. The information submitted here is used on our website, meetup.com and for other aspects of organising and running the event.</p>
<h2>After Applying</h2>
<p>If you've already applied and been accepted, we will have sent you a link to the <a href="https://www.wpldn.uk/speaker-pack">WordPress London speaker pack</a>.  This contains a general overview of what to expect when you speak at #WPLDN.  If you have any questions not covered by the pack please <a href="https://www.wpldn.uk/contact">do reach out to us</a>.  We're on hand to ensure your speaking experience is both positive and beneficial to yourself and the WordPress London audience.</p>
