	<h2>The WordPress London Meetup</h2>
<p>Also known as <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-WordPress/">#wpldn</a> is a monthly meetup for web professionals or end users who interact with WordPress, held the last Thursday of the month.</p>
<p>The format is usually 2-3 talks (usually developer focused but <a href="https://wpldn.uk/attend/">check the listings</a>), an open Q&amp;A session, followed by networking at a local bar.</p>
<p>It’s a great place to share ideas, techniques and meet other WordPress lovers.</p>
	<h3>When it all started</h3>
<p>13 August 2008 saw the first meetup in London focused on the WordPress community.  This was followed by <a href="https://wpldn.uk/speaker/keith-devon/">Keith Devon</a> running regular monthly events.  In 2013 <a href="https://wpldn.uk/speaker/dan-maby/">Dan Maby</a>, <a href="https://wpldn.uk/speaker/graham-armfield/">Graham Armfield</a> and <a href="https://wpldn.uk/speaker/ngaire-ackerley/">Ngaire Ackerley</a> joined the organisational team.  During 2017 both <a href="https://wpldn.uk/speaker/annabelle-woodger/">Annabelle Woodger</a> and <a href="https://wpldn.uk/speaker/gary-jones/">Gary Jones</a> came onboard to support the events.</p>
<p>Over the years the WordPress London Meetup has grown to a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/London-WordPress/">community of nearly 2,500</a> WordPress developers, designers, users and business owners.  We've had the pleasure of hearing from hundreds of the <a href="https://wpldn.uk/speakers/">WordPress communities speakers</a>, covering a wide variety <a href="https://wpldn.uk/subjects">talk subjects</a>.</p>
<h3>Where it's all going</h3>
<p>As the community and popularity of the events has grown, so have the costs.  Fortunately the WordPress London Meetup has been able to <a href="https://wpldn.uk/supporters/">partner with some exceptional companies</a> from within the WordPress ecosystem.  If you think your company would benefit from coverage at one of our popular events then we'd love to <a href="https://wpldn.uk/supporting-wordpress-london-meetup/">hear from you</a>.</p>
<p>At the heart of the WordPress London Meetup is the community.  With the continued growth and the ever changing business of WordPress, we're always looking for <a href="https://wpldn.uk/feedback">ways to improve</a> the #WPLDN offering.  <a href="https://wpandup.org">Partnering with WP&amp;UP</a> in 2018 is our next step forward.</p>
