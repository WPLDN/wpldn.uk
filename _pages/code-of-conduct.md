	<h2 style="font-size: 20px;">All WordPress London Meetups are free, inclusive &amp; open to everyone.</h2>
<h3>1. Purpose</h3>
<p>The WordPress London Meetup believes our community should be truly open for everyone.  As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, preferred operating system, programming language, or text editor.</p>
<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>We invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other participants to help us realise a safe and positive event experience for everyone.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Open Source Citizenship</strong></h3>
<p>A supplemental goal of this code of conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognise and strengthen the relationships between what we do and the community at large.</p>
<p>In service of this goal, the WordPress London Meetup organisers will be taking nominations for exemplary citizens throughout the event and will recognise select participants after the event on the website.</p>
<p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.  You can nominate someone at the Registration table or online at <a href="https://www.wpldn.uk/contact/">https://www.wpldn.uk/contact/</a></p>
<h3><strong>3. Expected </strong><b>Behaviour</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
<li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behaviour and speech.</li>
<li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert event organisers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.</li>
<li>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you help to create the WordPress London Meetup and make it your own.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. Unacceptable Behaviours</strong></h3>
<p>Unacceptable behaviour include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any attendees of the WordPress London Meetup and related events.  All WordPress London Meetup venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>
<p>Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Consequences Of Unacceptable Behaviours</strong><b> </b></h3>
<p>Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated whether by other attendees, organisers, venue staff, sponsors, or other patrons of the WordPress London Meetup venues.</p>
<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in unacceptable behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the event without warning or refund.</p>
<h3><strong>6. What To Do If You Witness Or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behaviour</strong></h3>
<p>If you are subject to unacceptable behaviour, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify an event organiser as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The WordPress London Meetup team will be available to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, to provide escorts, or to otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behaviour to feel safe for the duration of the event.  Any volunteer can connect you with an event organiser. You can also come to the Registration desk and ask for the organisers.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Scope</strong></h3>
<p>We expect all event participants (sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other guests) to abide by this code of conduct at all event venues and event-related social events.</p>
