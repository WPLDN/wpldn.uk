Ric has worked in linux and windows administration/architecture for over 10 years. Previous roles have included working at ticketmaster and channel 4 television, both very high load environments. He now runs his own consultancy and managed service business Ngineered ltd where he deals with a very varied array of clients. During his time at channel 4 Ric lead the new media team who were responsible for deploying all the microsites to support TV shows and series, this resulted in over 200 new sites per year, many of which were WordPress.
