Joel's company makes websites &amp; he's been in the game for a long old time. He was wrestling with IE3 (yes 3!) and table-based layouts whilst many of the current generation of coders were still on the potty. Whilst this means he is old &amp; decrepit, it does also mean that he has lots of experience which he's more than willing to share.

Joel has been in permanent roles (American Express, British Airways), has contracted, has freelanced at agencies &amp; has now been working for himself, and now managing a team, for over 13 years.

Joel's current website is at <a href="http://joelhughes.com/">http://joelhughes.com</a> but that is subject to change as his business is on the move.

He also runs the Port80 web &amp; 'The Business of Web Design' conferences in South Wales (<a href="http://port80events.co.uk/">http://port80events.co.uk/</a> &amp;
<a href="http://2014.thebusinessofwebdesign.co.uk/">http://2014.thebusinessofwebdesign.co.uk/</a>).

He is married to Jess, has two children (Lily &amp; Gene) and one cat (Mr Pickles).
