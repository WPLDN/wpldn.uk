Milos is a designer with a computer science degree and the founder of Citrus Mist design studio. He started programming at the age of 12 and a couple of years later, in 2000 during the dark age of DHTML, he started making websites. A self-professed coffee addict, avid foodie, and an incurable typography buff, he mainly works on identity and web design projects with startups and small- to medium-sized businesses. He codes his own designs most of the time.
