David is the boss at interconnect/<strong>it</strong> in Liverpool. He’s the boss because he’s the worst coder on the team and is also willing to stand up and talk to people. He’s also old, has been round the IT block a few times, and without too much prompting, will probably ramble on about how he’s seen it all before and that we can learn a lot from how things were done on old machines.
