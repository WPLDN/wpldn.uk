Ben founded Matter Solutions in 2000 after leaving a finance job in the City. He lived in Wapping and Aldgate working on various projects as the coder behind some pretty cool designers and tiny agencies, along the way he was roped into some AdWords and SEO projects. In 2006 he emigrated to Brisbane Australia to raise a family and began looking to expand, the business grew to service UK based clients and then in 2008 it changed back down to one-man-band. In 2010 things took off locally in Brisbane and he's now heads a full service digital marketing agency of 14 and growing.
