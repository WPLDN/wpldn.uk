Kirsty is a web designer / WordPress developer living in Shropshire. She has been working within the web industry in one way or another for ten years and running her own web business (imaginatively called Kirsty Burgoine Ltd.) for 5 years. She specialises in building bespoke WordPress websites for clients large and small, and, as the only 'official' employee in her company, she is proud to be employee of the month EVERY month!

A self-confessed geek, Kirsty is also one of the founders of Shropgeek, organising events for geeky people in Shropshire including (R)Evolution 2015, a full-day conference of web and technology talks: <a href="http://2015.shropgeek-revolution.co.uk/">http://2015.shropgeek-revolution.co.uk/</a>.
