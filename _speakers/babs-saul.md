Babs (or Barbara – whatever suits…) discovered WordPress in 2008 and has helped small business owners and organisations make the most of WP for their blogs and websites ever since.

Also known as The Blogmistress, she loves enabling people to work with WordPress themselves and to get blogging!

Within the WordCamp London 2018 team, Babs is Ana’s deputy and again lead organiser for the wonderful Volunteers.
