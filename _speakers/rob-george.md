Rob has been building web applications since 1999 and I’ve helped improve many businesses by building custom applications that precisely fit their needs.

Many businesses struggle on with management software that just doesn’t fit their need, often struggling with huge spreadsheet lists that just aren’t fit for purpose.  Businesses recognise these problems but don’t know where to turn to solve them.
