Sarah Semark is a designer, developer, and world-traveller. After running a business for eight years, she now works for Automattic where she spends her days building WordPressy things.

When sheâ€™s not busy making things, Sarah likes obsessing over typography, collecting impractical footwear, and exploring new places.
