I'm a Generalist through-and-through: none of this "not my job" nonsense. I've turned my hand to many tasks - from hiring to requirements capture, from writing bids to security reviewing websites, from writing wordpress plugins to publishing ruby gems.

I value small teams, short iterations and lots of client and user feedback. Clients who understand that web sites and services are for their users and not for them are good clients. I love the expressiveness of Ruby, and I don't think I could work somewhere that doesn't use git.
