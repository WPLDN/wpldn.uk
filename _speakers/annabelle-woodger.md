Annabelle is a relative newcomer to the WordPress community, but since discovering how welcoming it is, she hasn’t looked back!  She originally began translating WordPress into en_GB back in September 2016, quickly demonstrating her abilities and impressing the existing GTE team, becoming a General Translation Editor that same month.

A huge language nerd, she is currently learning Japanese (having passed the JLPT N5 in Dec 2016, now working towards N4 for Dec 2017), and reading as much as she can on linguistics and poetry. When not doing language-based activities, you can find her doing photography, being passionate about disability rights, and babbling excitedly about unicorns on Twitter.
