Iâ€™m an Amazon bestselling author, online teacher, graphic designer, entrepreneur, and ex-slacker who wants freedom for you and success for your business.

I want to help and inspire people to build sustainable online businesses, financial independence, earn passive income and experience greater freedom, health and happiness in their lives.

My company aims to provide the best design and marketing services possible. We offer complete web and branding solutions whilst putting the client at the center of our working day.

Since 1992 I have been working as a designer for print and web in advertising agencies, marketing consultants and publishers in London. Before this I was a journalist and designer for EMAP and BBC magazines and then progressed to The Guardian and The Independent newspapers and their color supplements in London, UK.
