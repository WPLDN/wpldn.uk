Annabel started her career in PR (non profit) before moving on to publishing and consumer law (Which? magazine) followed by advertising and HR.  She founded <a href="http://irenicon.co.uk/">Irenicon</a> in 1980 (an employment law and HR consultancy) and has spent the intervening years helping some of the largest organisations in the UK (and some of the smallest) sort out the people and employment law issues that come with change.  She founded <a href="http://koffeeklatch.co.uk/">KoffeeKlatch</a> in 2009 specifically to support organisations outsourcing to freelancers.  Her practical expertise in outsourcing to VAs, web designers, bookkeepers, trainers and more, is a key part of her speakers story.
