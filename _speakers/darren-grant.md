I am passionate about the web. There's no other industry that continues to evolve so drastically. It continually challenges us to be in touch with the cutting edge and to be prepared to re-evaluate best practice.

I specialise in front-end development and love creating slick and intuitive interfaces that provide a fantastic user experience. Much of my experience is working in small teams which require a large amount of versatility. So I also have a good deal of experience with; server-side scripting and databases, conceptualising user experiences and technical solutions, and client-facing in new business and requirements gathering processes.

My primary skills are in HTML5, CSS (SASS, CSS3 features, modular architectures), Javascript (including Angular, GulpJS and jQuery), Wordpress and PHP.
