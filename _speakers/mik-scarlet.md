With over 30 years in the media Mik was one of the first well known disabled people to appear on TV in the UK, working on shows such as Beat That, From The Edge, The Travel Show, BBC News and C5 News.  Alongside his media career he is one of the UK’s leading access and inclusion experts.  He advises major companies and government bodies on how to create and maintain systems that ensure disabled people, and all other protected characteristics as described by the Equality Act 2010, are fully included in society.
