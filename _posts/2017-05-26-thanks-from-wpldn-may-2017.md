<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let's start by first thanking Annabelle, JJ and Louise for the great lineup of varied talks at the WordPress London Meetup last night.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was another busy #wpldn with the events first all female line of speakers.  We felt it was important to make this recognition but also be clear that the fact that these individuals are female is not their defining character.  They are all individually talented in their own fields of expertise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The WordPress community is a wide and diverse mix of people and at #wpldn we take pride in hearing the voice of this community.  Often for the first time.</span></p>

<h2 class="p2"><span class="s2"><a href="https://wpldn.uk/speaker/annabelle-woodger"><b>Annabelle's Talk</b></a></span></h2>
