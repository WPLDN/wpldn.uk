No matter if your product, business plans or plugin is functional and well crafted: there comes a time where a user or client knocks at your door, and they aren’t happy at all with you.

Supporting users is not an easy job, not to mention when they’re angry or upset, and this can affect your emotional and professional balance.

In this presentation I’m going to share some useful tips and tricks I deploy when dealing with upset customers, to turn them into a potential happy users. I’ll also share my advice on how to maintain an assertive and positive attitude when things go south.

This talk aims to all the people who can possibly interact with users and are looking to fine-tune their customer support skills.
