WordCamp London will be 20th - 22nd March. We're about to open the call for speakers and we'd love for as many of the WPLDN meetup to apply as possible. In this presentation I'll share with you some of my knowledge and experience as both a WordCamp organiser and a speaker. I'll talk about why you might want to speak at a WordCamp, how to put together your application, how the speaker selection process works, and what speaking at a WordCamp involves. I'll also answer any questions about WordCamp London and about the speaking process.
