Lets take a look at how we can get WordPress to look for plugin updates from private Github repositories. This talk covers why we need such a thing, how to look through WordPress source code to find an entry point to hook our custom updater, how we can get information from Github to tell us there are updates and writing some code to put everything together from what we have learnt so far.
