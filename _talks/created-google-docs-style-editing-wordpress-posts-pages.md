<a href="https://poetica.com/">Poetica</a> is a beta WordPress plugin that inserts Google Docs-style collaboration into your WordPress posts and pages.

Co-founder and CEO, Anna Maybank, and full-stack engineer, Abby Millward, are going to talk about how they’ve rethought collaboration, from both a technical and design perspective, and why they think improving the editor experience in WordPress is so important for keeping up with changing user expectations.

They’ll also demo the plugin and talk about some of the challenges of working with TinyMCE..
