<em>“WordPress at the United Nations”</em> is about my experience doing WordPress consulting at the United Nations Head Quarters in Manhattan, New York.

The UN is a rather interesting organisation in how it uses platforms like WordPress and Drupal so I’d love to share my experiences with the WordPress community.
