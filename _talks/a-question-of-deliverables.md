Before responsive design, there was "standard" design. Keeping the client in the loop with standard design was easy, you showed them a visual and then created a pixel perfect website based on that visual. But as more internet enabled devices came on the market, responsive design became more common and the practice of pixel perfect designs became increasing difficult to maintain, keeping the client in the loop using "the old ways" became impractical.

So how do we deal with this? What deliverables do we provide to the client and at what stages? There is no one-fit solution to this so instead I will tell you a few of the things I tried and how and why they failed. Hopefully you can then find a method to suit you and avoid some of the mistakes I made.
