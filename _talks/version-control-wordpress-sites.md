The way WordPress was created is very "forward-centric" â€“ you click in the admin area and the changes are applied immediately. It would be often useful, though, to roll back the change if it caused any sort of trouble (broken plugin update, human mistake, etc.). The talk discusses how a technique of version control can help with that, what are the challenges when applying it in the world of WordPress, and what approaches and tools are available today.
