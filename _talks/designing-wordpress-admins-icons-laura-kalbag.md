The 'Customizer' was introduced in Wordpress 3.4, allowing users to toggle settings on their site with a live preview before saving them. This talk will show how any theme can use the powerful Theme Customisation API to add customisable elements to a theme that will let users/clients preview and publish real changes on the fly. We'll also cover some of awesome things we've managed to achieve using it at FactoryMedia.
