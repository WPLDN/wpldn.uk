We all live in a ‘gig’ economy.  But how should you work with freelancers to make sure you are all trading ethically?

Is it OK to find the cheapest person anywhere in the world and send them your stuff?  Are there ethical issues around fair wages?  Are there ethical and legal concerns about client data?  How to you deal fairly with copyright and software rights when working with an outsourced team?  How do you find your own way to something robust and resilient that you can be proud of?

In this engaging talk you will explore these issues and create your own ‘map’ of what chimes with your values and business plus get access to our Web Designers Guide to Ethical Outsourcing.
