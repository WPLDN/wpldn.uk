Changing what you don't like in the WordPress core, a plugin or a framework is not an easy task.

Many developers don't have a clue about what is important for accessibility. But telling developers they're doing accessibility wrong or just posting: “this is all wrong, fix it” doesn't always get accessibility on the agenda, or get a positive response.

But if WordPress doesn’t give you what you want, don’t just grumble or be intimidated by other developers, change it yourself - and give back to the WordPress community. You may be surprised how many people were waiting for that.

A month ago the Genesis Accessible plugin and the Leiden theme were published. Together they can make a Genesis website WCAG 2 accessible out-of-the-box. Find out how I created these things, and what the response was.
