I'll share the 10 most important things I've learned since I started to use WordPress and the experiences faced in starting a WordPress-focused web development agency.

I'll share stuff on how focusing on a single path and managing your ideas, risks, fears and failures will make you better at what you do. I'll also include my own personal mantra about why I chose to go 100% WordPress, quite simply: “You’re either a genius or an idiot if you build your own CMS, choose wisely”.

My hope is that everyone can take something away from this talk. In the spirit of open-source and WordPress I feel that we should always be open and share our career paths if only to inspire the next generation not to make the same mistakes!
