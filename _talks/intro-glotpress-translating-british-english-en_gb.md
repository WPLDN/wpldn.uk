In this bite-sized talk, we'll be going over GlotPress, the plugin used to translate WordPress, exploring what it is and how it can be used for collaborative translation. Â There will also be a live demonstration of GlotPress, translating a few strings into en_GB (perhaps strings from a plugin/theme developed by an attendee!)
