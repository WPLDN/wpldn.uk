Lot's of web hosts now offer one-click installation of WordPress, but what if your chosen host doesn't, or if you want more control over your configuration? What if you've used the one-click, but it's installed WordPress in a subdirectory and you want your blog to exist in the site root?

You can do it all yourself and it's probably easier than you think.

In this talk I will be taking you step-by-step through installing WordPress on your web server and setting up your WordPress site.
