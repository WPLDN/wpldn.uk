So you've got your WordPress site up and running and visitors are finding it through search engines. But are you giving them enough information about your site once they've arrived?

In this presentation I'd like to share some ideas for simple tweaks you can make to your theme that can help improve the usability of your site - specifically in the areas of search, blog pages, archive pages, 'landing' pages and 'read more' links. I'll be using some common (and less well-known) WordPress functions and array values, and also recommending a useful plugin for improving search results.
