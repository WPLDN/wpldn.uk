WordPress is designed to make website administration simple. This talk covers how StudioA2 deliver projects that allow flexibility on the front end while not compromising usability on the back end.

A well designed site that functions correctly for visitors can be a nightmare for your clients if the administration is not user friendly. We've built dozens of WordPress sites, each with its own unique design, layout and content structure. We deliver a bespoke admin interface that empowers clients to take full control of site content within various layouts without needing to know the first thing about HTML/CSS.
