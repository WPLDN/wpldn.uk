Up until WooCommerce 2.1, each order had to be shipped via a single method with a single price. This changed in 2.1 and WooCommerce now allows each package to be quoted and shipped individually.

This means we can manipulate the basket and split the oredr based on the shipping method, then each package can be marked to ‘ship via’ a method of your choosing. This is useful if certain packages can only be shipped by certain methods.

In this talk I will show how you can split your shipping into different "packages" and treat each package in a diffrent way.
