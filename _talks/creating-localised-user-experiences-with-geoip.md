The Internet has made the world a much smaller place. Your website can reach practically anywhere on Earth. Wouldn't it make sense to immediately serve your visitors the relevant, accurate content that they’re looking for, versus making them select their geographic location from a pulldown menu or a map? Not knowing the physical location of your visitors can limit you to only serving generic content that may not be relevant to visitors coming from different locations. That can kill engagement and negatively impact sales - just watch your bounce rate climb! In this session, learn about the uses of GeoIP, a technology that gives you the ability to create a “just for you” feeling by presenting geographically-specific content from WordPress sites based on a visitor’s physical location.
