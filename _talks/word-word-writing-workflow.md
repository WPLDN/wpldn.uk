From blog posts to internal reports, reviews, documentations, business proposals or social statuses, there is a wide range of cases to write for. Whether youâ€™re an accomplished writer or not, you need to have an established writing workflow in order to create better content with less resources.

In this talk Franz will explain how he starts from a simple idea and develops a good text that is ready to be read by someone else. Tools of the trade, good and bad habits, text accessibility, but also lessons learned from pragmatics, sociolinguistics, and other linguistics subfields.

This session is aimed not only at authors and content creators, but also at all professionals who want to write more effectively for different purposes.
