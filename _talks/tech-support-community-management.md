Communities — from close knit bands of commenters to busy international forums — are fun and engaging but the issues members have with the site and with each other require ongoing attention. In this talk, JJ will discuss the unexpected benefits of hands on tech support, advocate for prioritising interactions with members during the design and development phases and explain her approach to sticky interpersonal situations, including the dark side of empathy and how far to go for the greater good.
