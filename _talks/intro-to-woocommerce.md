In this presentation I’ll show you how easy it is to set up an online store with WooCommerce. I’ll be building a store from scratch ‘live’ in only 20 mins. I’ll show you how to set up your shop, add products (simple, virtual, grouped, affiliate and variable), add product galleries, add sections to your shop, set up checkout, how to take payment and more. We’ve been running WooCommerce on pootlepress.com (http://pootlepress.com/) for the past year and I’ll give you some tips and tricks on how to optimise a WooCommerce store.
