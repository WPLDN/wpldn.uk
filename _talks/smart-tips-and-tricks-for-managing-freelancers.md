Freelancer is the ‘new employment’. Most organisations use freelancers for some tasks but some even build an entire business model on using freelancers. It’s not all ‘legal free’. Freelancers in the UK have a whole range of rights – and some, despite their label are not really freelancers at all but turn out to be employees. How do you plot your way through this territory and arrive at profitable and reliable relationships with the freelancers you pay – with no nasty surprises from the tax man? In this talk Annabel explores the status of freelancers, how labels can be deceiving and suggests ways to approach hiring freelancers that will protect your business from harm.
