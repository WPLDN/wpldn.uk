There are a number of ways to speed up sites. Caching is one of them. However caching can't be used in all instances, for example when checking out on an eCommerce site. In those circumstances the speed of talking to the database is important.

WordPress and its plugins aren't the greatest at structuring data. In this talk we'll walk through some basics of how databases work, how WordPress is set up, and why some of the queries you thought should be fast, aren't. And hopefully what to do about some of those.
