My business uses Wordpress a lot to help meet client's website needs. This talk is not techy but, instead, will touch on the business side of building & selling Wordpress websites. Aside from discussing lessons learnt along the way, Joel will also drift off into his (probably wrong) predictions about the future of Wordpress and web publishing.

Joel's company makes websites & he's been in the game for a long old time. He was wrestling with IE3 (yes 3!) and table based layouts whilst many of the current generation of coders were still on the potty. Whilst this means he is old & decrepit, it does also mean that he has lots of experience which he's more than willing to share.

Joel has been in permanent roles (American Express, British Airways), has contracted, has freelanced at agencies & has now been working for himself, and now managing a team, for over 13 years.
