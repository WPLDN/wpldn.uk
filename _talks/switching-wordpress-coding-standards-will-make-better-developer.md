WordPress Coding Standards have been around for a while, yet many developers don’t write code that conforms to them, let alone know they exist. This was the case with me until September 2015 when I made the switch, and now I wish I’d dived in earlier! In this talk I’ll explain what they are, how they will help you write better, cleaner and more secure code and why you should be using them for all WordPress projects.
