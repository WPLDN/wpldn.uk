Are you a growth-hacking marketing guru, creating compelling content that resonates with your target audience and drives value?

Translation: Do you write loads of blog posts and eBooks hoping people will one day buy your stuff?

Sounds pretty stressful.

In this talk, Alice will look at the reasons for writing things online and argue that it isn’t realistic, or necessary, to constantly churn out loads of content.

Together, we’ll throw off the content marketing shackles and focus instead on creating UX-led, well-written core website pages.

You’ll go away with the tools needed to create your own content strategy that includes:
<ul>
 	<li>Realistic user personas</li>
 	<li>Your brand’s tone of voice</li>
 	<li>An SEO strategy</li>
 	<li>UX-led page structure</li>
</ul>
