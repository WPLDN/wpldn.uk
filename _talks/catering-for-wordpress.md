<b>Building an online integrated information and support system for the catering / hospitality sector.</b>

The catering industry has very few tools available to help them create/store recipes, plan menus and work out costings that can be shared with members of staff and other branches of a chain.

This talk would cover one solution to this, showing how WordPress has been used as an intranet for businesses in the restaurant/catering industry. Features include working as a tool to itemise ingredients, help plan and budget dishes and menus, work out costings for bulk recipes down to individual portions and include other factors such as VAT and a variable gross profit.

All of this has been set up using a combination of WordPress MU, custom plugins, custom post types, custom fields and a bespoke theme with all of the necessary maths functions built in. There will be some knowledge of PHP, theme development, plugin development and jQuery assumed for this talk.
