The ability to 'think on your feet' is not only valuable but vital to your business’ success. Without the confidence to do so, you can be really limiting your business growth. We improvise everywhere- conversations, meetings, interviews, presentations, sometimes without realising it. All we need to do is develop these everyday skills further to see positive, measurable change in the success of professional interactions.
