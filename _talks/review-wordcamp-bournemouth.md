If you haven't yet got your tickets for Bournemouth on July 12-13th get you tickets here: <a class="link" title="http://2014.bournemouth.wordcamp.org/tickets/" href="http://2014.bournemouth.wordcamp.org/tickets/" target="__blank">http://2014.bournemouth.wordcamp.org/tickets/</a> . It's always a fun-filled weekend of learning and socialising!

Otherwise if you can't make it, don't worry because we'll have an excellent review of the two-day conference from one of the organisers - Jonathan Harris.
