A few months ago Dan and a few others started <a href="http://exodusesports.com/">http://exodusesports.com</a>. They used WordPress, which allowed us to get off the ground quickly, taking advantage of a lot of newer technologies ranging from the new WordPress restful api with angular to websockets for realtime match results, but not forgetting the basics including extending the XMLRPC interface, custom post types and posts 2 posts plugin to link it all together.

Dan will be talking about building it, the problems, the solutions and were they are going next.
