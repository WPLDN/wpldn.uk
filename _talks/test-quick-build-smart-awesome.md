A lot of the time businesses are so focused on the big shiny thing at the end of a roadmap that nobody ever stops to question, is this the right thing? Is this something users want? Will this actually move the needle for the business?

In this talk, Adam goes over failures, successes, and general lessons learned over his career to date in publishing about testing hypotheses, engaging with users and bringing stakeholders along the journey. The technical restrictions and expectations that can come from that, and pitfalls to avoid will be discussed.
